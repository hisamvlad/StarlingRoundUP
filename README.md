# StarlingRoundUP
Starling Bank Round Up Challenge


A project to work with Starling Bank API. 

It takes all the transactions in a given week and rounds them up to the
nearest pound. For example with spending of £4.35, £5.20 and £0.87, the round-up
would be £1.58. This amount then gets transferred into a savings goal, helping the
customer save for future adventures.
